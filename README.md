# Program Optimization Lab 202X

Implementing an LLVM analysis framework based upon the Seidl Program Optimization Lecture.

## Build

### Build against a system-wide installed LLVM
Install the LLVM packages from your distro's package manager, e.g. Ubuntu 20.04:

    # install the necessary LLVM packages
    sudo apt install cmake clang libclang-10-dev llvm-10-dev
    # now continue by building the project
    git clone https://versioncontrolseidl.in.tum.de/petter/llvm-abstractinterpretation.git
    cd llvm-abstractinterpretation
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPATH_TO_LLVM=/usr/lib/llvm-10 ..
    make

You can do this, however the precompiled LLVM binaries come without symbol names, thus debugging
might be a little harder this way. Alterntively consider the following route:

### Build against custom downloaded LLVM Sources
Get the LLVM source code from [here](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html). Then get clang as well, into `llvm/tools`. Create a build directory somewhere, initialise CMake, and build. For example

    # From llvm-10.0.0-src, or whatever the version is now
    wget https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-10.0.0/llvm-10.0.0.src.tar.xz
    tar xf llvm-10.0.0.src.tar.xz
    # now also download clang
    cd llvm-10.0.0.src/tools
    wget https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-10.0.0/clang-10.0.0.src.tar.xz
    tar xf clang-10.0.0.src.tar.xz
    mv clang-10.0.0.src clang
    cd ../..
    # now continue by building LLVM
    mkdir llvm_build
    cd llvm_build
    # important: Don't forget to restrict to X86, otherwise prepare for a day of compiling
    cmake ../llvm-10.0.0-src -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86
    # 4x parallelized make, which will probably fail due to RAM consumption
    make -j4
    # make -j1 in order to catch up, where the parallel make aborted

On a 4 core i7-8550U with 16GB RAM this may take up to 3:00h for a sequentially run make ( `make -j1` ) to account for a poor man's RAM equipment. Also, the build will need at least 50GB of disk space, be sure to have enough room...


If there are errors regarding missing header files, you probably need to rebuild llvm.

# Running the Analyzer

After successfull compilation, you can run your particular analysis on some example target, e.g.:

    $LLVM_BUILD/bin/opt -load build/llvm-pain.so -painpass -S -o /dev/null output/if-then-else-2.ll

# Visualization of Results

There is a plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), that can be obtained from https://versioncontrolseidl.in.tum.de/schwarz/llvm-abstractinterpretation-vscode-plugin . This expects your inferred abstract domain values in a JSON file with extension `$target.out` next to `$target.ll`, which is used to present a CFG representation of your analysis target.
